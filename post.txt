Here is a progressive web app I just published that will hopefully prove useful. This originated from the desire to have an app that could randomly generate workout routines in order to prevent staleness and promote muscle confusion. After not finding any existing apps that worked the way I wanted, it seemed like building one from scratch would be the best approach, and could also be a good exercise in web development. It turned out to be a fun build and works just as I had imagined! Feel free to give it a try, and check out the project on Github for more information.
