  <h3 align="center">Motivator App</h3>

  <p align="center">
    A list making app to help with routine and indecision.
    Sort bucket items into collections and create radomly
    generated to-do lists. Check and delete items to track
    progress, and stay motivated!
    <br />
    <br />
    This app is and motivational experiment based on the idea
    productivity is often hindered by decision exhaustion and 
    option overload. By having to-do lists randomly generated, 
    the app makes the decisions leaving more energy for the tasks.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
A ground-up responsive design progressive web application built to be a living example of my work as a front-end developer. This app works with modern browsers and may also be installed as a standalone application on mobile devices. App data is saved to browser localstorage which will persist through sessions until browser cache is deleted.
