<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project was built ground-up (no UI libraries used) to showcase my abilities as a designer and developer. It is a responsive design progressive web application that may also be installed as a standalone app on mobile devices. Application data is saved to browser local storage which will persist through sessions, but will be cleared, or reset with browser cache is deleted.
